**Project Roadmap**
All work to be completed by Jakob Beck.

1. Evaluate the codebase located (here)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26001920/calculating-sales-taxes-using-functions-in-python] to determine how best to adapt it to a computer cost builder.
2. Create the first draft of the program that:
  1. Gets user input.
  2. Calculates the cost of the build.
3. Evaluate the feasability of using SQL (here)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inserting-variables-to-database-table-using-python/] to see if it would be reasonable, or necessary, to use SQL to create a database of user input.
4. Either impliment the SQL or finish coding without. The final program will include:
  A. Prompt user for:
    a. CPU
    b. RAM (optionally multiple)
    c. GPU (optional) (optionally multiple)
    d. Motherboard
    e. Case
    f. Power supply
    g. Accessories or peripherals (optionally multiple)
  B. Gathering user input for:
    a. Part name
    b. Shipping?
    c. Tax?
    d. Cost?
   C. Creating a printout of the build that can be easily compared to other created builds
   D. Add the total cost of the build, including tax and shipping. Display these numbers seperately and together.
   E. If SQL is implimented, the data will be commmited to a database where the user's builds will be accessible when they reopen the program after closing it.
